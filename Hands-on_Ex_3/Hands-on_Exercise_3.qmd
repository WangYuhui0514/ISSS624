# 1 Overview

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to build an OD matrix by using *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops* data set downloaded from LTA DataMall.

# 2 Getting Started

For the purpose of this exercise, four r packages will be used. They are:

-   sf for importing, integrating, processing and transforming geospatial data.

-   tidyverse for importing, integrating, wrangling and visualising data.

-   tmap for creating thematic maps.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tmap, sf, DT, stplanr,
               performance,
               ggpubr, tidyverse)
```

# 3 **Preparing the Flow Data**

### **3.1 Importing the OD data**

Firstly, we will import the *Passenger Volume by Origin Destination Bus Stops* data set downloaded from LTA DataMall by using `read_csv()` of **readr** package.
